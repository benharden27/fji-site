We recently worked with the Falmouth Public Schools to establish a Food Justice program at Falmouth High School.

<\br>

## Overview

The program is centered in practical agriculture and the racial and climate stories that shape our past, present and future food systems.

In class students explore the history of racial injustice with regards to land ownership and food access and how this has shaped how people have access to wealth and healthy food in the present day.

With climate change expected to shift the agricultural picture and impact low income and communities of color more keenly, we also explore these issues and what communities can do to ensure equitable adaptation.

The history and environment of Cape Cod forms a major part of the backdrop to this class given the rich cultural diversity and environmental changes over many centuries.

Importantly, students take this learning into the field - we use a small farm to empower students to take sustainable action and positively impact our community. Students gain agency through planting healthy cultutally appropriate food and being involved in the planning from sowing to distribtuion.
