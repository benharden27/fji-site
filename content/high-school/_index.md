We are working with the Falmouth School District to establish the Race, Climate and Food program at Falmouth High School.

<\br>

## Overview

The program is centered in practical agriculture and the racial and climate stories that shape our past, present and future food systems.

In class students are going to explore the history of racial injustice with regards to land ownership and food access and how this has shaped how people have access to wealth and healthy food in the present day.

With climate change expected to shift the agricultural picture and impact low income and communities of color more keemly, we also need to explore these issues and what communities can do to ensure equitable adaptation.

The history and environment of cape cod will form a major part of the backdrop to this class given the rich cultural diversity and environmental changes over many centuries.

Students will then take their learning into the field - we will use a small farm to empower students to take sustainable action and impact our community . planting healthy cultutally approrpiate food and being involved in the planning from sowing to distribtuion will give them agency.
